According to <b>Fox</b>, they seem to have found that in the form of David Green.<br> <b style="color:blue">Megan Fox </b> most certainly has a point when it comes to the tone of what a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie should feel like. <h4 text-align="center">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</h4> Studios in general seem to be catching on to this trend, handing off beloved properties to lifelong fans that will treat the material with the respect it deserves. For example, J.J. Abrams’ handling of the new Star Wars, or Joss Whedon’s take on The Avengers have both definitively proven that someone who has a prior relationship with the source material is generally the person with the best creative vision for big screen adaptations.Ever since Batman Begins hit theaters back in 2005, superhero adaptations have consistently attempted to do things in a "dark," and "gritty" fashion, regardless of the hero. With some characters this approach works – see: Daredevil – but all too often studios apply it to characters that inherently have much more of a sense of humor than the Dark Knight could ever hope for – see: The Amazing Spider-Man franchise.',
